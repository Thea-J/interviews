//Plan:
//Create a form that takes in the parameter of a postcode ✅
//onSubmit the postcode from the form will be sent in a GET request to the given API endpoint ✅
//Validate postcode with given Regex ✅
//If correct, process with HTTP request ✅
//If incorrect, provide error handling 
//Render the addresses for that postcode from the HTTP response 

//Improvements:
// Separate Components for the form & address rendering ... & api ?
// Error messages should not hide postcodeForm ✅
// Error message should change depending on most recent error
// Jest tests
// Privacy: encrypt postcodes & auth key 
// Styling
